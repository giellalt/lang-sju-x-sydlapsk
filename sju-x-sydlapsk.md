INTRODUCTION TO MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSER OF 18th century Southern Saami LANGUAGE.

# Definitions for Multichar_Symbols

## Analysis symbols
The morphological analyses of wordforms for the 18th century Southern Saami
language are presented in this system in terms of the following symbols.
(It is highly suggested to follow existing standards when adding new tags).

The parts-of-speech are:

Diacritical triggers

The parts of speech are further split up into:

The Usage extents are marked using following tags:

The nominals are inflected in the following Case and Number

The possession is marked as such:
The comparative forms are:
Numerals are classified under:
Verb moods are:
Verb personal forms are:
Other verb forms are

* +Symbol = independent symbols in the text stream, like £, €, ©
Special symbols are classified with:
The verbs are syntactically split according to transitivity:
Special multiword units are analysed with:
Non-dictionary words can be recognised with:

Question and Focus particles:

Semantics are classified with

Derivations are classified under the morphophonetic form of the suffix, the
source and target part-of-speech.

Morphophonology

## Flag diacritics
We have manually optimised the structure of our lexicon using following
flag diacritics to restrict morhpological combinatorics - only allow compounds
with verbs if the verb is further derived into a noun again:
|  @P.NeedNoun.ON@ | (Dis)allow compounds with verbs unless nominalised
|  @D.NeedNoun.ON@ | (Dis)allow compounds with verbs unless nominalised
|  @C.NeedNoun@ | (Dis)allow compounds with verbs unless nominalised

For languages that allow compounding, the following flag diacritics are needed
to control position-based compounding restrictions for nominals. Their use is
handled automatically if combined with +CmpN/xxx tags. If not used, they will
do no harm.
|  @P.CmpFrst.FALSE@ | Require that words tagged as such only appear first
|  @D.CmpPref.TRUE@ | Block such words from entering ENDLEX
|  @P.CmpPref.FALSE@ | Block these words from making further compounds
|  @D.CmpLast.TRUE@ | Block such words from entering R
|  @D.CmpNone.TRUE@ | Combines with the next tag to prohibit compounding
|  @U.CmpNone.FALSE@ | Combines with the prev tag to prohibit compounding
|  @P.CmpOnly.TRUE@ | Sets a flag to indicate that the word has passed R
|  @D.CmpOnly.FALSE@ | Disallow words coming directly from root.

Use the following flag diacritics to control downcasing of derived proper
nouns (e.g. Finnish Pariisi -> pariisilainen). See e.g. North Sámi for how to use
these flags. There exists a ready-made regex that will do the actual down-casing
given the proper use of these flags.
|  @U.Cap.Obl@ | Allowing downcasing of derived names: deatnulasj.
|  @U.Cap.Opt@ | Allowing downcasing of derived names: deatnulasj.

The word forms in 18th century Southern Saami language start from the lexeme roots of basic
word classes, or optionally from prefixes:

## Sets containing sets of lists and tags

This part of the file lists a large number of sets based partly upon the tags defined above, and
partly upon lexemes drawn from the lexicon.
See the sourcefile itself to inspect the sets, what follows here is an overview of the set types.

### Sets for Single-word sets

INITIAL

### Sets for word or not

WORD
NOT-COMMA

### Case sets

ADLVCASE

CASE-AGREEMENT
CASE

NOT-NOM
NOT-GEN
NOT-ACC

### Verb sets

NOT-V

### Sets for finiteness and mood

REAL-NEG

MOOD-V

NOT-PRFPRC

### Sets for person

SG1-V
SG2-V
SG3-V
DU1-V
DU2-V
DU3-V
PL1-V
PL2-V
PL3-V

### Pronoun sets

### Adjectival sets and their complements

### Adverbial sets and their complements

### Sets of elements with common syntactic behaviour

### NP sets defined according to their morphosyntactic features

### The PRE-NP-HEAD family of sets

These sets model noun phrases (NPs). The idea is to first define whatever can
occur in front of the head of the NP, and thereafter negate that with the
expression **WORD - premodifiers**.

### Border sets and their complements

### Grammarchecker sets

Usage:
```
$ make
$ echo "ja, ja" | hfst-tokenise --giella-cg tokeniser-disamb-gt-desc.pmhfst
$ echo "Juos gorreválggain lea (dárbbašlaš) deavdit gáibádusa boasttu olmmoš, man mielde lahtuid." | hfst-tokenise --giella-cg tokeniser-disamb-gt-desc.pmhfst

```

Pmatch documentation:
<https://github.com/hfst/hfst/wiki/HfstPmatch>

Characters which have analyses in the lexicon, but can appear without spaces
before/after, that is, with no context conditions, and adjacent to words:
* Punct contains ASCII punctuation marks
* The symbol after m-dash is soft-hyphen `U+00AD`
* The symbol following {•} is byte-order-mark / zero-width no-break space
`U+FEFF`.

Whitespace contains ASCII white space and
the List contains some unicode white space characters
* En Quad U+2000 to Zero-Width Joiner U+200d'
* Narrow No-Break Space U+202F
* Medium Mathematical Space U+205F
* Word joiner U+2060

Apart from what's in our morphology, there are
1. unknown word-like forms, and
2. unmatched strings
We want to give 1) a match, but let 2) be treated specially by
`hfst-tokenise -a`
Unknowns are made of:
* lower-case ASCII
* upper-case ASCII
* select extended latin symbols
ASCII digits
* select symbols
* Combining diacritics as individual symbols,
* various symbols from Private area (probably Microsoft),
so far:
* U+F0B7 for "x in box"

## Unknown handling
Unknowns are tagged ?? and treated specially with `hfst-tokenise`
hfst-tokenise --giella-cg will treat such empty analyses as unknowns, and
remove empty analyses from other readings. Empty readings are also
legal in CG, they get a default baseform equal to the wordform, but
no tag to check, so it's safer to let hfst-tokenise handle them.

Finally we mark as a token any sequence making up a:
* known word in context
* unknown (OOV) token in context
* sequence of word and punctuation
* URL in context

* * *
